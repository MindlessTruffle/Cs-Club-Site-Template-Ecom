# Setting up

This is for anyone who wants to set this project up!!!
>
> - Make sure you have node.js installed. (you can visit their website [here](https://nodejs.org/en))

Next step is to git clone this repo. (Assuming you have git installed)

```ps
git clone https://github.com/MindlessTruffle/Cs-Club-Site-Template-Ecom.git
```

or download and extract the zip file from github.

### Running

To run the project all you do is `cd` into the `vite-project` folder and run:

```ps
npm install
```

to install all dependencies
in order to run the project:

```ps
npm run dev
```

(this is assuming you have already installed the dependencies)

### compiling

Assuming you want to compile just run:

```ps
npm run build
```

(Will throw errors when building, I coded it all in typescript with 0 knowledge of how to use it ðŸ˜­)

Hope this helps!
